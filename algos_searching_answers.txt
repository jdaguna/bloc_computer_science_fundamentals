Questions

What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search? 

A: Looking up a name in a phone book starting from the beginning. 

2. What is a real-life scenario of binary search: 

A: Looking for a book in a library.

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

A: It would take 7 iterations using linear search.

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

A: It would take 3 interactions using binary search.

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: Since the data is unsorted I would use Linear Search. In order to implement binary search we would first have to sort the data set and then apply binary search, which would result in a slower time complexity.

6: Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: I would use binary search as it excels with large data sets. It searches at O(log n) compared to Linear search of O(n).

Programming Assignment

1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word “Albatross
“ In the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.
 A:

 function binarySearch(dictionary, word){
   let count = 0;
   let low = 0;
   let high = dictionary.length-1;

  while (low <= high){
     count += 1;
     let mid = Math.round((low + high) / 2);
      if (dictionary[mid] > word)
       high = mid -1;
      else if (dictionary[mid] < word)
       low = mid + 1;
      else
       return word + " found after " + count + " iterations";
    }
    return false;
   }

2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

function linearSearch(tank, fish){
  for (let i = 0; i < tank.length; i++){
    if (tank[i] === fish)
      return "Found " + fish + " after " + i + " tries."
  }
}
