#### Questions

1. Define and compare recursion and iteration.

A: Recursion is calling the same function within itself to solve a problem. Iteration solves the problem within its function and doesn't need to call itself.

Recursive solutions could be easier to implement but may come at a cost of resources. Iteration solutions are a bit more complex to work out but may be more efficient.

2. Name five algorithms that are commonly implemented by recursion.

A: Factorial, Fibonacci, Binary Search, Greatest Common Divisor, Merge Sort

3. When should you use recursion, and when should you avoid recursion? Give examples for each.

A: 
We use recursion to help break down a complex problem into simple steps by calling itself. Recursion excels in searching file structures, binary search trees, and sorting algorithms such as merge sort and Quicksort. 

We should avoid recursion if we have limited memory space as it is dependent on the call stack. For example, calling a really large number using a recursive formula for the Fibonacci  sequence  would must likely result in a stack overflow.


4. Compare the recursive and iterative solutions to the three algorithms from the checkpoint (factorial, maximum, and fibonacci). What is similar, and what is different?

A:
They both implement the same basic formula that returns the correct result. Recursion relies on returning stack calls whereas iterative solutions stores a variable to return.

5. Given a multi-dimensional collection (such as an array) where the number of dimensions is unknown, write a recursive algorithm to count the number of items in the entire collection.

A:

function length(arr) {
  let counter = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    if(typeof arr[i] === "number")
      counter++;
    else{
      counter += length(arr[i]);
    }
  }
  return counter;
}

console.log(length([1,[2,[3,4,5,[6],7],8],9]));

5. A palindrome is a word or phrase whose spelling is the same either direction (e.g., racecar). Write a recursive algorithm to determine if a given word or phrase is a palindrome.

A:

function isPalindrome(word){
  var word = word.toLowerCase();
  let length = word.length;
  if (length === 0 || length === 1){
    return true;
  }

  if(word[0] === word[length-1])
    return isPalindrome(word.slice(1,length-1));
  else
    return false;
}

console.log(isPalindrome('racecar'));

6. Google Easter Egg: Google the term "recursion". Google will prompt you with "Did you mean: recursion". Explain why this behavior exhibits properties of recursion.

A: Recursion is all about calling itself. So when clicking the recursion easter egg it will link us back to the same page with the same easter egg.
