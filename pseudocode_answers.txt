Short Answer:
Why do programmers use pseudocode?
We use pseudocode to quickly write algorithms without having to follow a particular language’s syntax.

If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
Nothing will happen. Pseudocode is written in English not in a programming language.

Programming Assignment:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF first number is greater than the second number 
	RETURN first number
ELSE
	RETURN second number

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

INIT number to 1
WHILE number is less than  or equal to 100
	PRINT number
	INCREMENT number
END WHILE

3. Create a function that search for a specific entry in a phonebook.

INPUT number
INIT a counter to 0
WHILE counter is less than to the total numbers in phonebook
	IF number is equal to phone number at counter
		RETURN true
	INCREMENT counter
END WHILE
RETURN false

4.

var number = prompt(“Please enter phone number to search”, “(555) 555-5555”); 
var counter = 0;
while counter<phonebook.length{
	if number === phonebook[counter]
		return true;
	counter += 1;
} 
return false;
